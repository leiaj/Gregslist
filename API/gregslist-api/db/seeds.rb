    {title: "Mobile brothel",
      description: "197? Chrysler motor home. I bought this former mobile brothel from one of the oldest pimps in Nevada. I believe it’s the one I was conceived and born in. My mother found it for me a few years ago while volunteering for the humane society in Vegas. I bought it right away for $10,000 because it’s kind of sentimental to us since my father was an aeronautical engineer turned Navy Seal firefighter and a CIA spy who worked for Richard Nixon himself. Needless to say didn’t have much time for dating so he would visit my mom on his rare time off from work in this mobile brothel that she worked in while she saved up money for college. Anyways my mom and I hoped to restore it to it’s former glory days and get her and it back on the road. But after applying for permits, we were denied for a massive crab infestation and mold issues. It starts and runs well. Steers straight and is good in gas. I’d like to get around $10k for it as is. Clean title in hand. Thanks.
P.S. Dad if you are reading this please email me as i would love to meet you someday.",

I feel sad just chucking him since he has made such an impression in attempt at life and propagation. If you have a yard, or garden, and would be willing to take this glorious plant from my hands, I'd be happy, knowing he is able to live his dreams.

I've included photos, to show his gnarly awesomeness, and I hope you can help provide him a great loving home aka fertile soil to grow.",

      description: "I regret it but selling my custom built Motorized Bicycle, please look at the photos for more details.

It has a Honda 4 stroke GXH50 49.4cc 2.5hp engine on a SPECIALIZED HARD ROCK 21spd
High end mountain bike with Weinman Rims.

Note the 3 to 1 ratio Torq-A-Verter TAV2 model which allows for good climbing power and idle at stops.

I built this unit for metal detecting days and traveling down fire lane roads and going across corn fields so it has a lot of low in power plus a good top end speed for down the road cursing with the Torq-A-Verter.

Best of all it is a 4 stroke engine so no mixing oil in the gas.

Note the bike frame has not been altered so take it apart and its back to a stock bike or pop the drive chain and it's a pedal bike.

I will respond to all messages sent to me from Craigs List and who give me your contact phone number.

This is also listed on Ebay [...] just in case you trust buying there more than here.

Pick up in Kenosha Wisconsin as I will not ship. I do take verified PayPal and will help with trucking pick up but will not crate in case you want to arrange shipping pick up.",
